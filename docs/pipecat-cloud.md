### ✅ **Agent Provisioning (Create/Delete)**

- **Creation**: Agents are deployed using the `pcc agent start` command or via the REST API endpoint `POST /{agent_name}/start`.

- **Deletion**: Agents can be deleted using the CLI command `pcc agent delete {agent_name}`. 

- **Initial Configuration**: Configuration is passed through the `body` field in the start request. This data is accessible within the agent's `bot()` method. 

- **FrameContext Update Mechanism**: The documentation does not explicitly mention a `FrameContext` update mechanism. However, dynamic configuration updates are supported via the `updateConfig` method in the client SDKs. 

---

### ✅ **Agent Identification**

- **Stable Identifier**: Upon starting an agent, a session ID is provided, which can serve as a stable identifier for that instance.

- **Mapping Storage**: You can store this session ID in your database to track and manage agent instances effectively.

---

### ✅ **Dynamic Updates**

- **Runtime Configuration Updates**: Pipecat supports dynamic updates to agent configurations at runtime using the `updateConfig` method provided by the client SDKs. This allows changes without restarting the agent. 

- **Full Configuration Updates**: The `updateConfig` method enables full configuration updates during runtime, facilitating dynamic behavior changes in agents.

---

### ✅ **Agent Status Querying**

- **Status Endpoint**: The CLI command `pcc agent status {agent_name}` provides the current status of an agent deployment, including health and conditions. 

- **Active Sessions**: To view active sessions for a specific agent, use the CLI command `pcc agent sessions {agent_name}`. 

---

### ✅ **Authentication**

- **Method**: Pipecat Cloud uses API keys for authentication. Requests to the REST API require the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header. 

- **Integration with Identity Providers**: While the documentation specifies API key usage, integration with identity providers like Auth0 would require custom implementation on your end.

### ✅ **Support & Clarifications**

- **Multi-Tenancy Support**: The documentation does not explicitly mention multi-tenancy support. It's advisable to contact Pipecat support for detailed information.

- **Rate Limits**: The Daily API, which Pipecat Cloud leverages, enforces rate limits to ensure stability. For most API endpoints, the limit is 20 requests per second or 100 requests over a 5-second window. 

- **Contacting Support**: For ambiguities regarding multi-tenancy, dynamic update mechanisms, status querying, and rate limits, reaching out to Pipecat support is recommended.

---

### ✅ **Conclusion**

Pipecat Cloud provides the necessary API capabilities for dynamic agent management and updates, including provisioning, identification, runtime configuration changes, status querying, and authentication.
